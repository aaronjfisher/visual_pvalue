We've added a second version of our analysis in response to a great question posed in the PeerJ questions section for our paper. It was suggested that we  incorporate random intercept terms to account for variability of the randomly generated plots.

* version-1_PeerJ contains our original analysis
* version-2_Random_Intercepts_for_Plots contains a basic implementation of this suggestion, assuming the same variance for the random intercepts of all plot styles.
